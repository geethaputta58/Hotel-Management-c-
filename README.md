Smart Hotel Management System

An efficient and intelligent hotel management system built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system handles hotel bookings, customer management, and billing with a structured and modular approach.

OOP Concepts Used:

✅ Encapsulation – Customer and booking details are securely managed within classes.

✅ Abstraction – Unnecessary details are hidden, providing a simple interface for users.

✅ Inheritance – Code reusability achieved by deriving classes for different hotel functionalities.

✅ Polymorphism – Functions are overloaded/overridden to handle multiple operations efficiently.

✅ File Handling – Data is stored and retrieved using file operations for persistence.
